# ECON773

Repository Purpose
This repository is the single shared workspace for this assignment. All analysis, data processing, and writing must happen inside this folder. No files should be edited, created, or stored outside the repository. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Required Tools
Each group member must have the following installed:

- Positron
- Git
- A GitHub account with access to this repository
- R and/or Python as required for the assignment

------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Setup (Do This Once)

1. Clone the repository
Open Positron.
Select “Clone Git Repository”.
Paste the repository URL.
Choose a local folder and open the project.

2. Do not rename the root folder
All file paths assume the current folder is the project root.

------------------------------------------------------------

Folder Structure Rules

The repository uses a fixed structure:

- data/raw  
  Contains original, unmodified data. These files must never be edited.

- data/clean  
  Contains cleaned or transformed datasets generated by scripts.

- src  
  Contains all code files for cleaning, analysis, and estimation.

- output  
  Contains generated tables, figures, and intermediate outputs.

- paper  
  Contains the final written assignment (Quarto, LaTeX, or text).

No files may live outside these folders.

------------------------------------------------------------

Data Rules

- Raw data is read-only.
- All cleaning steps must be done via scripts in src.
- Cleaned data is saved to data/clean.
- Scripts must be runnable from a fresh clone of the repository.

------------------------------------------------------------

Path Rules (Critical)

All file paths must be relative to the project root.

Correct examples:
data/raw/jobcorps.csv
data/clean/analysis_data.csv

Incorrect examples:
setwd()
/Users/name/Documents/...
C:\Users\...

Never change the working directory inside scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------

Daily Workflow (Everyone Follows This)

1. Pull before starting work
Always pull from the remote repository before editing files.

2. Make small, focused changes
Edit only the files you are responsible for.

3. Commit frequently
Each commit should represent one logical change.
Use clear commit messages describing what was done.

4. Push after committing
Do not leave unpushed commits.

------------------------------------------------------------

Merge Conflicts

If a merge conflict occurs:

- Do not panic.
- Use Positron’s merge editor to resolve conflicts.
- Keep only the correct final version of the code.
- Commit the resolved file immediately.

To minimize conflicts, avoid editing the same file as someone else at the same time.

------------------------------------------------------------

Division of Labor

Each major file should have a clear owner.
Examples:
- One person owns data cleaning scripts.
- One person owns analysis and regressions.
- One person owns the final paper file.

If you need to edit someone else’s file, coordinate first.

------------------------------------------------------------

Environment Consistency (If Using R)

This project uses renv to ensure identical R packages.

- Do not install packages outside renv.
- If renv.lock changes, commit it.
- If packages fail to load, run renv::restore().

------------------------------------------------------------

Files That Must Not Be Committed

Do not commit:
- Temporary files
- IDE cache files
- Personal notes
- Output generated outside the repository
- Credentials or API keys

------------------------------------------------------------

Final Rule

If it is not in this repository, it does not exist.
If it cannot be reproduced from a fresh clone, it is not finished.
